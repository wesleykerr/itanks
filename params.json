{"name":"iTanks","tagline":"Survive and destroy the competition.","body":"# iTanks\r\n\r\niTanks is a web game where you control a tank and try to outlast the other tanks.  It was a collaboration between myself, Tegan Moersfelder, and Ryan Appel as part of the UW-Stout 48 hour programming contest.  I had heard of this new game development tool called [Monkey X](http://www.monkey-x.com/) and wanted to see how hard it was to make a game in it.  So as part of the 48 hours we had to learn the language and create a fun game.\r\n\r\n* [Play](http://www.wesley-kerr.com/games/itanks/MonkeyGame.html)\r\n\r\n# Requirements\r\n\r\n* [Monkey X](http://www.monkey-x.com) - The free or pro version.  Last validated with **MonkeyXPro82b**\r\n* [Diddy](https://code.google.com/p/diddy/) - An open-source framework that extends Monkey-X \r\n  * Caveat - The latest version of diddy breaks the build since they changed the API.  I've included an old version so that you can still build in the lib/ directory.\r\n\r\nThe only other change is that you have to update the HTML template to have width=960 and height=640 instead of the defaults that come with Monkey X otherwise everything will not render correctly.\r\n\r\n## Programming\r\n\r\n* [Wesley Kerr](http://www.wesley-kerr.com)\r\n* [Ryan Appel](http://ryan-appel.com)\r\n\r\n## Art\r\n\r\n* [Tegan Moersfelder](http://teegersm.blogspot.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
